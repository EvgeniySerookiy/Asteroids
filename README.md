<p align="leftr">The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible. The player controls a spaceship equipped with two types of weapons: single bullets and a laser. Single bullets hit only one target at a time. The laser can hit all targets within its beam. The player has only one life. If the spaceship is destroyed, your score is compared to the high score. If your score is higher, it will be recorded as the new high score.</p>
